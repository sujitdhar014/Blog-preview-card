## 🔄 My Workflow

1. **Project Setup**:
   - Initialise a new repository on GitHub to keep track of progress.
   - Clone the repository to my local machine and create the project structure.
   
2. **HTML Structure**:
   - Write the basic HTML structure, including `header`, `main`, and `footer` sections.
   - Ensure that the content is semantic and accessible.
   
3. **CSS Styling**:
   - Style the elements using Flexbox to ensure the layout is responsive.
   - Use custom fonts and colours based on the provided design.
   - Implement hover effects for interactive elements like the card.

4. **Testing**:
   - Test the project in different screen sizes to ensure it's responsive.
   - Validate the HTML and CSS code to check for any errors.

5. **Deploying**:
   - Host the project on platforms like **GitHub Pages**.

## 🎯 What I Learned

- The importance of **responsive design** and how to effectively use **Flexbox** to create a flexible layout.
- How to implement **hover effects** and interactive states for elements.
- Best practices for organising and structuring an HTML project for clarity and ease of development.

## 🔍 What I'd Do Differently

- **Accessibility improvements**: I would add ARIA attributes to improve accessibility for users with disabilities.
- **Refining mobile layout**: I would further refine the mobile layout to ensure the text and images are more optimised for small screens.
